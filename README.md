Speedy is a speedrun timer.

Features:
- Global split hotkey: Use your desktop environment to send a SIGUSR1 signal to speedy (`killall -USR1 speedy`)
- Automatic saving: Completed runs are saved in a data directory, usually `~/.local/share/speedy/`
- Race against your personal best: The personal best is saved in a pb.ron file automatically.
- Audio confirmations: Plays a sound when the run starts, when you split and when the run ended
